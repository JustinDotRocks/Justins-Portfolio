      The SMU Interactive Campus Map is a web-based application that transforms how students, 
      faculty, and visitors navigate the Saint Mary's University campus.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Interactive campus buildings and facilities</li>
      <li>Detailed information for campus buildings and their amenities</li>
      <li>Accessibility information for buildings</li>
      <li>Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go navigation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This project demonstrates my ability to build practical web applications that solve 
      real-world navigation problems. The interactive map makes it easy for users to find 
      classrooms, offices, dining options, and other essential campus locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application was built with a focus on user experience, ensuring that the interface
      is intuitive and the information is easy to access across all devices.
